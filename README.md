## Hiding an HTML element 
By using the attribute hidden , you can easily hide an HTML element natively. As a result, that element wonâ€™t be displayed on the web page.

```<p hidden>This paragraph won't show up. It's hidden by HTML.</p>```

## Use the inset shorthand in CSS
If top , left , right , and bottom properties have the same value, you can just use the property inset instead and your code will look much cleaner.

```
div.dontDoThis{
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}

div.doThis{
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
}
```
